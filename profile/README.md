# Welcome to the GD Store Project!
The **GD Store** is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed for the Geometry Dash community. It features a wide array of products tailored specifically for the Geometry Dash community, all integrated seamlessly with the Square Online API for managing items and transactions.

## The GD Store GitHub Organization
This GitHub organization manages the codebases for both the frontend and backend of the GD Store project. The organization includes the following repositories:

- **[gd-store-frontend](https://github.com/TheGDStore/gd-store-frontend)**: This repository houses the frontend for the GD Store, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically fetches and displays product listings from the backend API, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface for the shop.
  
- **[gd-store-backend](https://github.com/TheGDStore/gd-store-backend)**: This repository contains the backend code for the GD Store, developed with Hono, a minimal web framework for Cloudflare Workers, and TypeScript. This is responsible for handling API requests, integrating with the Square API to manage product listings and transactions. The repository includes patches for specific modules to ensure compatibility and functionality within the Cloudflare Workers environment. It uses Wrangler for development and deployment, making it well-suited for serverless application deployments.
